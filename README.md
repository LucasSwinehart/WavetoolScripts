# Wavetool Remote Solo Control

This project allows automated remote control of [Wavetool](https://wavetool.fi/) by programmatically selecting and soloing channels based on pre-scanned screen coordinates. It is built in AppleScript for macOS automation and can be integrated with Companion (Bitfocus), Qlab, etc.

## Features/Goals

- Solo Wavetool channels remotely by name via AppleScript UI automation 
- Automatic window bounds detection
- Auto-rescan if Wavetool window changes (resize/move)

## How It Works

### Main Scripts:

1. `scan_wavetool.scpt`:

   - Brings Wavetool to the front
   - Scans the visible ChannelStrips on screen
   - Records each beltpack's name and click position
   - Saves the results to a simple `WavetoolCache.txt` file in your home folder

   - NOTE: The scan is fairly slow as it parses all readable text for each 'Channel Strip' sequentially and requires that the window be in the foreground. 
  
   - A scan returns: 
      - Channel Name
      - Channel Number
      - Ant A (Letter 'A' if connected)
      - Ant B (Letter 'B' if connected)
      - Battery Life Timer

2. `solo_channel.scpt`:

   - Loads `WavetoolCache.txt`
   - Brings Wavetool to the front
   - Clears currently soloed channels (`c` key)
   - Moves the mouse and clicks the target beltpack based on stored coordinates
   - If Wavetool window bounds have changed, automatically re-runs the scan and reloads the fresh positions before clicking

### Simple Script:

3. `sequential_scan_and_click.scpt`:
   - A simplified, slower script that:
     - Scans Wavetool sequentially for matching Channel Name data each time script is run
     - Clicks channel strip with a Channel Name matching argument
    
   - To Run:
     - Download Script, place in a secure folder, and copy pathname
     - brew install cliclick (or other method)
     - Run: osascript /path/to/script.scpt "YourChannelName"
       - Replacing /path/to/script.scpt and YourChannelName with your pathname and targeted Wavetool channel name respectively


## Requirements & Dependencies

- **Wavetool 3** (or later) installed on macOS
- **cliclick** utility installed (`brew install cliclick`) for simulated mouse movement/click
- macOS Accessibility permissions granted to:
  - `Script Editor`
  - Terminal (if running from shell scripts)
  - Any control software calling the scripts

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install [cliclick](https://github.com/BlueM/cliclick):**

```bash
brew install cliclick
```

2. **Save Scripts:**

   - Place `scan_wavetool.scpt`, `solo_channel.scpt`, and `sequential_scan_and_click.scpt` somewhere safe (e.g., `/Users/yourname/Documents/WavetoolControl/`)

3. **Edit Paths:**

   - In `solo_channel.scpt`, update the line:

```applescript
do shell script "osascript '/path/to/scan_wavetool.scpt'"
```

- to match the real path to your `scan_wavetool.scpt`.

4. **First-Time Scan:**

   - Run `scan_wavetool.scpt` manually (Script Editor or Terminal osascript) to create the initial `WavetoolCache.txt`.

5. **Trigger Solo Commands:**

   - Call `solo_channel.scpt` with the channel name in Wavetool as an argument:

```bash
osascript /path/to/solo_channel.scpt "YourChannelName"
```

6. **Optional:**
   - Integrate into Companion buttons or other show control triggers!

## Notes, Limitations, and Issues

- If ChannelStrips are added, removed, or rearranged, a manual rescan is recommended
- Scripts only tested on Wavetool 3 connected to Sennheiser EM6000 series
- `sequential_scan_and_click.scpt` assumes scanning immediately before clicking

- This line may return an error. Homebrew install of cliclick may result in a different pathname, adjust accordingly:
  ```bash
     do shell script "/opt/homebrew/bin/cliclick m:" & clickX & "," & clickY & " && /opt/homebrew/bin/cliclick c:" & clickX & "," & clickY
  ```
   - Run this command in Terminal to find your pathname: which cliclick

Future projects:

- Restore foreground app & cursor position
- Integrated Remote Trigger Support (currently requires local shell script)
- Group channel and multi-solo actions
- Document Wavetool Network Protocol (TCP NSKeyedArchiver - Highly Unofficial API)
